# React + Vite


The objective of this project is to create a web or mobile application that uses the NASA APOD API to display daily images from space. The application will pull the latest image along with its description and present it to the user in an engaging, easy-to-navigate format. The app will also allow users to view images from a random date on reload.


To test this app on your machine you need to clone this repository and run this command on your terminal provided you are in the directory of the app to install the necessary dependencies

    npm install

Then run this command to run it on your local server

    npm run dev
